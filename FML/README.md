# Flow Map Learning Implementation

This is a Deep Neural Network-Residual Network based modeling of Ordinary Differential Equations using Recurrent Loss Style Training. An implementation of Paper "Flow Map Learning for Unknown Dynamical Systems: Overview, Implementation, and Benchmarks
". This is a precursor to Modeling-SDE-with-FML.
