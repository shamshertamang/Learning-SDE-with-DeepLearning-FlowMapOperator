Implementation of Paper - Learning Stochastic Dynamical System Via Flow Map Operator

In this paper, I implemented **Recurrent Loss Residual Network** for deterministic solution of the stochastic curves and **Generative Adversarial Networks (WGAN-GP)** for stochastic solution of the curves. The results section has some of the results.
